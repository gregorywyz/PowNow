# PowNow
General Assembly Project #3

## Description
PowNow is research tool designed for adventurous skiers. Knowing current weather and snow conditions is crucial for any backcountry skier and this app helps those skiers stay informed on what's happening at the local ski areas. PowNow takes the user's location and finds the closest ski areas in Washington. The search results then link to detailed weather conditions for that resort. User that sign in will have the ability to create, edit, and delete comments on conditions for any ski resort.

## Purpose
PowNow is a web app built by Greg Wyszynski to project specs from General Assembly as a required deliverable for the Web Development Immersive Course. The project is a showcase of the ability to learn a new framework and produce with it. AngularJS was introduced a week prior to the assignment while Sails.js and MongoDB were introduced during starting week of the assingment.

## Technology
Built on the Sails.js and AngularJS platforms using a MongoDB database system and deployed on Heroku. This project fully encompasses the MEAN stack environments as Sails.js is built on top of Node.js. CRUD actions, RESTful routing, and MVC were incorporated into the project. A geospatial 2d index was created for MongoDB to allow for query searches based on the user's geolocation from HTML5. The Bootstrap css framework was then used for styling.

Modules used include: bcrypt, request, Express.

## External APIs
Used data from www.worldweatheronline.com/, and http://www.wunderground.com/

## What I Like Most
As an avid skier, this is an app that I personaly would use. I really enjoyed learning how to use MongoDB to find ski resorts based off of a current location.

## What I Like Least
In the short time frame, I was not able to find the exact data for snow conditions that I wanted. I will continue to work out this issue and find data sources so I can use this app next ski season.
