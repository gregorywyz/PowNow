        <p>Pow Now was built by Greg Wyszynski as a class project during my enrollment at General Assembly. I have a passion for skiing and a serious addiction to powder skiing. My visions for this app spawned from my road trip days where I could literally get out and ski anywhere. But how was I to know what ski areas were around and what kind of snow they were receiving. Pow Now solves that issue by geolocating the user and returning weather reports for the nearest ski areas. Comments for specific ski areas will even let the locals chime in and spread informantion on conditions that you will not find on weather reports.</p>

        <p>I used the technologies in the MEAN stack environment to build Pow Now. Including MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js and Bootstrap.</p>

        <p>Enjoy the app! Get out there and surf some powder this winter!</p>
